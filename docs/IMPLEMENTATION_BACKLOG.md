# Localhost Hub V2 Implementation Backlog

This backlog captures the current product direction in implementation order. Keep it updated as work lands.

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Real service management

- [x] Add initial Rust-managed process start/stop path for workspace services.
- [x] Add shell command execution in the repo cwd for npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, cargo, and arbitrary commands.
- [x] Add initial Tauri service events for started, stdout, stderr, exited, error, and stopped.
- [x] Stop Unix services by process group so child dev servers are not left behind.
- [x] Show initial PID and real uptime for managed services.
- [x] Add fallback stop-by-PID for services detected from process scanning but not started by the manager.
- [x] Add Rust query command for currently managed services so frontend state can recover after refresh/missed events.
- [x] Track service lifecycle states: stopped, starting, running, failed, crashed, exited, restarting.
- [ ] Track cwd, command, memory, CPU, and detected ports per managed service in the UI model.
- [ ] Implement robust restart and kill behavior.
- [ ] Reconnect UI state to already-running matching processes where practical.
- [ ] Add persisted service run history/state as needed.

### Real logs

- [x] Stream stdout/stderr from Rust to frontend.
- [x] Store per-service logs in frontend state.
- [ ] Add workspace-combined logs.
- [ ] Add timestamps, filtering, search, error highlighting, copy/export.

### Persist app preferences

- [x] Persist theme in config.
- [x] Persist density in config.
- [x] Persist accent color in config.
- [x] Persist sidebar width in config.
- [ ] Add editor path setting.
- [ ] Add terminal path setting.

### Project detail and metadata

- [ ] Populate `data.projects` from scanned repos.
- [ ] Make Project Detail work with live scanned data.
- [ ] Add project tabs: Overview, Scripts, Git, GitHub, Ports, Logs, Health.
- [ ] Detect README/license files.
- [ ] Detect Docker/devcontainer files.
- [ ] Detect languages and dependency manifests.

### Project structure cleanup

- [x] Decide whether `dist/` should be committed or ignored consistently.
- [x] Stop tracking generated `dist/` and `node_modules/` files while keeping them ignored and present locally.
- [x] Remove or use unused `is_port_open`.
- [ ] Audit placeholder views and mark future-only surfaces clearly.
- [x] Keep generated build artifacts out of normal development diffs where possible.

- [ ] Show workflow failures.
- [ ] Show repo visibility.
- [ ] Open repo in browser.
- [ ] Open PR in browser.
- [ ] Copy repo URL.
- [ ] Create PR later.
- [ ] Add GitHub dashboard widgets: assigned PRs, review requests, failing workflows, recent repos.
- [ ] Add notifications later.

## Phase 4: Repo Health

- [ ] Track last commit age.

- [ ] Add optional metrics: commit frequency, contributor count, branch age, PR age, issue age.

## Phase 5: Optional AI Layer

- [ ] Generate commit messages from diffs.
- [ ] Explain diffs.
- [ ] Summarize repos.
- [ ] Summarize branch purpose.
- [ ] Explain logs/errors.
- [ ] Generate README summaries.

- [ ] Create Cursor/Codex task briefs.
- [ ] Answer "What was I working on?"
- [ ] Answer "What changed recently?"
- [ ] Design BYOK-compatible provider settings.

## Implementation Principles

- Keep local Git functionality independent from GitHub functionality.
- Prefer local-first behavior.
- Use Rust/Tauri for real process, filesystem, Git, and OS integration.
- Use GitHub APIs only for GitHub metadata and remote intelligence.
- Avoid overengineering; use `git2` where useful and system `git` where more reliable.
- Preserve a Linux-native, fast, information-dense workflow.
